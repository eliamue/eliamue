âœ§ Zesty, creative collaborator âœ§
My goal is to combine my background experience with my ever-developing tech skills in software development to improve the inclusivity, beauty, and accessibility of technology. 
I am passionate about building dynamic apps and web experiences that accommodate the needs of marginalized communities that have long been excluded from innovative technology.
